Yes, you can commit your project to GitHub even if there are minor issues. It’s common for projects to evolve and improve over time. Committing now allows you to:

Track your progress and changes.
Collaborate or get feedback.
Safely back up your work.
Just make sure your .gitignore is set (which it is), and avoid committing sensitive files like .env or large data files. You can always fix issues in future commits. Document any known issues in your README or as GitHub issues for clarity.
    Place your historical data file in the `data/` directory:
    ```
    MyTradingProject/
    └── crypto_trading_bot/
        ├── data/
        │   └── test_df_features.csv
    ```

This error means your local branch is not named main, or you haven’t made a commit yet. Here’s how to fix it:

Make sure you have committed your changes:
Check your current branch name:
```bash
git branch
```
If it says master, rename it to main (recommended for GitHub):
```bash
git branch -m master main
If it says master, rename it to main (recommended for GitHub):

Push to GitHub:
If you still get an error, make sure you have at least one commit before pushing.


Your local branch is still named master, not main. GitHub expects main by default for new repositories. To fix this, rename your branch and push:

This will push your code to the main branch on GitHub and resolve the error.

To rename your local branch to main, use the following command:

```bash
git branch -m master main
```

Then push the changes:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```
